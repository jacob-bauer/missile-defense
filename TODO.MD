## Immediate Scratch pad

## Critical
- When the game loads in, there should be a countdown to the game start, and thereon on new waves
	- New waves should have increasing difficulty, in enemy missile quantity, speed of launch, and missile speed
	- Introduce spawning of smart bombs
	- Introduce spawning of bombers
- Create and place cities that can take damage when an enemy missile hits them.
	- Could be that game_data needs an "attackable" array, which is simply the concatenation of silos and cities
	- Cities need some concept of health
- Defeating or surviving waves should lead into playing new waves
- Enemy missiles in the original game could split into multiple warheads partway through their flight.
	- This can be another knob to turn as we increase difficulty over time
- We need to introduce a new smart bomb type, which avoids friendly missiles on it's way to the target
- We need to introduce a bomber type, which is destructible itself, but also launches missiles as it travels horizontally through the screen.
- Save and track scores
