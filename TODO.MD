## Critical
- Figure out how to create and display a countdown to the user!
- Create a city that can take damage when an enemy missile hits it
- Determine when a missile explosion hits something, either enemy missile or city/silo
- Enemy missiles in the original game could split into multiple warheads
- When the game loads in, there should be a countdown to game start, then the game starts
